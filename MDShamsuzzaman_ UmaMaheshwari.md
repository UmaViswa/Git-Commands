Report
=======

The submission covers all the commands in detail, and sequence also makes sense. Since it was copied and pasted in the wordpad it sounded to be in sequence. 

The difference between both the submission:
	I have just sent the history which was asked to. And the person who I reviewed had send only the working commands copied and pasted. That also included the final output.
I didn’t use the “tag” command as I was not sure what it is used for and here it was given in detail.
I created two branch but didn’t try to delete the branch, the person has tried to delete the branch.
I  didn’t try “touch” command to create a new file as I tried to push the existing files to the git.


https://git-scm.com/doc has every git commands in detail with examples and explanation.

Learning GIT branch
===================

This seems to be easy to understand the Git commands and their functions more easily. 
But it seems to be annoying to type certain git commands repeatedly for every exercise for example creating git branch. We create Branch in the second exercise and that could have been carried out to the third or the following exercises. 
Other than this the link was very helpful to understand the whole Git process.
